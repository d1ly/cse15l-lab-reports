# cd command
The cd command stands for "current directory" and it is used to move between directories.
## cd no arguments

Using cd with no arguments resets the current directory to the home directory, also known as /home. I was in the ~/lecture1/messages directory, using cd reset me to home.
This is **not** an error and is an intentional/useful way for easy access to the home directory.

## cd to a directory
Using cd with directory as an argument is used to change and move inbetween directories. This allows easy access to the files in the directory.
This is **not** an error and allows movement between directories. 

## cd to a file
Using cd with a file as an argument is an **error**. This is because a file is not a directory and so the command "change directory" will not work.
