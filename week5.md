# CSE15L Week 5 Lab Report - Bugs and Commands
# Part 1: Bugs
## Finding bugs in ListExamples.java's filter function
## JUnit test with failure inducing input 

```
@Test 
public void testFilter1() {
  StringCheck sc = new StringCheck();
  List<String> testList = new ArrayList<>();
  
  testList.add("1234");
  testList.add("this is a string!");
  testList.add("stringtest");
  
  assertEquals(testList, ListExamples.filter(testList, sc));
}
```

## Junit test with no failure
```
@Test 
public void testFilter2() {
  StringCheck sc = new StringCheck();
  List<String> testList = new ArrayList<>();

  testList.add("only one string");

  assertEquals(testList, ListExamples.filter(testList, sc));
  }
```

## Output of the tests

![Image](junitweek5.PNG)

## Before code change
```
static List<String> filter(List<String> list, StringChecker sc) {
  List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
  for(String s: list) {
    if(sc.checkString(s)) {
      result.add(0, s);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

## After code change
```
  static List<String> filter(List<String> list, StringChecker sc) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for(String s: list) {
      if(sc.checkString(s)) {
        result.add(s); //Changed to append, not prepend
      }
    }
    return result;
  }
```

This fixes the bug because originally the filter function is supposed checks if each element is a string and then return the strings as a new list, in order of input.
The original code instead prepends the element to the front, causing a reverse order of the input.
I fixed it by changing `result.add(0, s);` to `result.add(s)` so that it would append the element once it was checked for string.
Then it is now fixed, since the filter function will check the input in order and then return the new list in the same order.


# Part 2 - Researching Commands
## The grep command

The `grep` command searches for lines that contain the mentioned string, and returns the corresponding line in the output
## `-i`

The -i option ignores case sensitivity.

```

Here we are looking for lines that have any sort of cases for "legislative." So here, `grep "Legislative" -i  technical/government/About_LSC/*` was
searching each file in /About_LSC for the string "legsilative" but also "Legislative" was found too as `-i` ignored case sensitivity. This is useful
to really find every use of a word, because if it was at a start of a sentence or used as a proper noun then it wouldn't be counted if `-i` wasn't there to ignore case sensitivty.

```
$ grep "patriot act" -i -r technical/*
technical/911report/chapter-10.txt:                September 11, an early version of what was to become the Patriot Act (officially,
technical/911report/chapter-10.txt:                the USA PATRIOT Act) began to take shape.
technical/911report/chapter-12.txt:                now far-flung entities constituting the intelligence community. The Patriot Act
technical/911report/chapter-12.txt:            Second, Congress responded, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, with the Patriot Act,

```

Another good use is seeing all the different mentions of all the sorts of ways to refer to something. 
The USA PATRIOT Act can both be referred to as PATRIOT or Patriot Act, as it's both an acronym and an actual word, so ignoring case sensitivty is good here.

## `-c`

The option `-c` counts the total numbers of lines where the string appears on the file

```
$ grep "9/11" -c technical/911report/*.txt
technical/911report/chapter-1.txt:19
technical/911report/chapter-10.txt:25
technical/911report/chapter-11.txt:33
technical/911report/chapter-12.txt:39
technical/911report/chapter-13.1.txt:15
technical/911report/chapter-13.2.txt:21
technical/911report/chapter-13.3.txt:13
technical/911report/chapter-13.4.txt:59
technical/911report/chapter-13.5.txt:63
technical/911report/chapter-2.txt:1
technical/911report/chapter-3.txt:42
technical/911report/chapter-5.txt:33
technical/911report/chapter-6.txt:17
technical/911report/chapter-7.txt:48
technical/911report/chapter-8.txt:11
technical/911report/chapter-9.txt:14
technical/911report/preface.txt:3
```
Here the string "9/11" appears on that many lines at least once, according to the number after the colon. For example `technical/911report/chapter-1.txt` has 19 lines where the pattern "9/11" appears at least once, and is a good indictator of line count of that string.

```
$ grep "United States" -c technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/*.txt
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_comparison.txt:10
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_Cost_Function.txt:1
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_CreamSkimming.txt:4
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_DeliveryCost.txt:3
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_RuralDelivery.txt:9
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_Scale.txt:4
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Gleiman_EMASpeech.txt:1
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Gleiman_gca2000.txt:0
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Mitchell_6-17-Mit.txt:18
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Mitchell_RMVancouver.txt:4
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Mitchell_spyros-first-class.txt:0
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Redacted_Study.txt:0
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/ReportToCongress2002WEB.txt:6
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/WolakSpeech_usps.txt:1
```

Here the string "United States" appears on that many lines at least once, according to the number after the colon. Useful to see how many lines mention the United States.

## `-n`
This option displays not only the matched line but also the line number.

```
$ grep "America" -n technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/*.txt
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_comparison.txt:62:onerous. It has been pointed out by the American co-authors of this

technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/WolakSpeech_usps.txt:13:machines, on-line information services CompuServe and America
```

The matched line is displayed like in the normal command, but also the line number in that file is also output. 
In `technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_comparison.txt` line 62 has the phrase "America."

```

The matched line is displayed like in the normal command, but also the line number in that file is also output. 
It can be useful for skipping specifically to that line number when reviewing the files.

## `-w`

The `-w` command searches for the exact matching phrase/string, as only whole words, so it doesn't grep strings part of bigger strings.

```

The command outputs only the lines that match "universe". So if a line says "universes" it will not be outputted as it doesn't word match.

Here only lines with "technical" in it, so lines that only have "technically" or "technicals" and other variations will not be included.
Overall this command is useful for getting exact word matches if needed, and exclude plural useges or other verbs/adverbs.
